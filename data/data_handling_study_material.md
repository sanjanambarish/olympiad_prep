# Data Handling - Class 8 Study Material

## 1. What is Data?
Data is a collection of facts or information. Examples include marks of students, daily temperatures, or number of people in different age groups.

## 2. Organizing Data
Instead of writing random numbers, we organize them using:
- Tables
- Tally Marks
- Pictographs
- Bar Graphs

## 3. Tally Marks
Tally marks help quickly count data in groups of 5.

**Example:**

| Fruit | Tally | Frequency |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Apple | |||| | 4 |
| Banana | |||| || | 7 |
| Orange | |||| |||| | 9 |

## 4. Pictograph
A pictograph uses pictures to show data. 

**Example:** One apple symbol = 2 apples. So three apple symbols = 6 apples.

## 5. Bar Graph
A bar graph uses bars (rectangles) to show data. Each bar's height represents the value.

## 6. Histogram (Advanced)
A histogram is like a bar graph but used for continuous data such as marks or heights.

## 7. Circle Graph (Pie Chart)
A circle graph is divided into sectors. Each sector represents a part of the whole.

## 8. Measures of Central Tendency
These are used to find the average or middle value.

- **Mean (Average):** Sum of values รท Number of values
  *Example: 10, 15, 20  Mean = (10+15+20)/3 = 15*
  
- **Median:** Middle value when data is arranged in order.
  *Example: 10, 15, 20  Median = 15*
  *If even number of values: 10, 20, 30, 40  Median = (20+30)/2 = 25*
  
- **Mode:** Value that appears most often.
  *Example: 10, 15, 15, 20  Mode = 15*

## 9. Probability (Introduction)
Probability tells how likely something is to happen.

*Example: Tossing a coin  Chance of Heads = 1/2*

**Formula:** Probability = Favourable Outcomes / Total Outcomes

*Example: Dice roll  Probability of 3 = 1/6*

## 10. Summary Table

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Data | Information in numbers |
| Tally Marks | Counting in 5s |
| Pictograph | Data using pictures |
| Bar Graph | Bars for comparison |
| Mean | Average |
| Median | Middle value |
| Mode | Most frequent number |
| Probability | Likelihood of an event |

## 11. Example Questions

1. Find the mean of 12, 15, 10, 13  (12+15+10+13)/4 = 12.5
2. Find the mode of 5, 7, 7, 8, 9  Mode = 7
3. Median of 2, 4, 6, 8  (4+6)/2 = 5
4. Probability of red ball from 3 red, 2 blue  3/5
